<h1>State Management Quiz</h1>
<p style="color: red" >Q1. Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the problems?</p>
<p style="color: blue">A1. An HTTP POST can be bookmarked, but since a bookmark only consists of the URL, all of the form parameters will be lost.
    This will often mean that the web server doesn't know what to do with the request, since it was expecting some form parameters. </p>
<p style="color: red">Q2. What is the purpose of request dispatching?</p>
<p style="color: blue">A2. The purpose of request dispatching is dispatching requests to any resource (such as HTML, Image, JSP, Servlet etc.) on the server via  Request Dispatcher interface. </p>
<p style="color: red">Q3. What is the difference between redirect and request dispatch?</p>
<p style="color: blue">A3. I redirect; request is redirected to client (Browser) and it will process the new URL, end User can see on which page url is redirected and processing is done at client side.
   In dispatch; servlet will internally forward the request to another servlet or jsp page, end user don’t know that which page is processed internally and processing is done at server side. </p>
<p style="color: red">Q4. What is an attribute ?</p>
<p style="color: blue">A4.An attribute is an object that is used to share information in a web app, it allows Servlets to share information among themselves. </p>
<p style="color: red">Q5.What is the difference between attributes and parameters?</p>
<p style="color: blue">A5. Parameters may come into our application from the client request, or may be configured through deployment descriptor (web.xml) elements or their corresponding annotations.
    Attributes are objects that are attached to various scopes and can be modified, retrieved or removed. Parameters are read only, attributes are read/write objects. And parameters are String objects,
    attributes can be objects of any type.</p>
<p style="color: red">Q6. What are dangers of using attributes?</p>
<p style="color: blue">A6. Context and session attributes are not thread safe.  </p>
<p style="color: red">Q7. What does it mean to say that http is stateless? Give an example of a stateful protocol.</p>
<p style="color: blue">A7. Http protocol is stateless in a sense that it does not require the server to retain information or status about each user for the duration of multiple requests. FTP is an example of stateful
protocol and Http can be assumed stateful by using cookies.</p>
<p style="color: red">Q8. Give 5 different methods for maintaining state information (count each attribute scope as one method).</p>
<p style="color: blue">A8. 5 different methods to maintain state are:
<ol style="color: blue"> <li> request scope: destroyed when servlet finishes processing request </li>
    <li> session scope: destroyed when user closes browser</li>
    <li> application scope destroyed when the container stopped.</li>
    <li> Cookies saved on browser, either temporary (deleted when the browser closes) or permanent </li>
    <li> Hidden fields on a form </li> </ol> </p>
<p style="color: red">Q9. How long does a session last?</p>
<p style="color: blue">A9. A session can last for the period of session-timeout set by the DD(web.xml) or the setMaxInactiveInterval method set by the programmer. Also session can be invalidated manually by the
    programmer after completing some tasks.</p>
<p style="color: red" >Q10. What is a cookie, and how long does a cookie last?</p>
<p style="color: blue">A10. A cookie is a small piece of data stored on the client-side which servers use when communicating with clients. A cookie can last for a period of time configured by the programmer
by a method setMaxAge().</p>
<p style="color: red" >Q11. What is the purpose of URL rewriting?</p>
<p style="color: blue">A11. Url rewriting is a process of appending or modifying any url structure while loading a page. If our browser does not support cookies, URL rewriting provides us with another
    session tracking alternative.  </p>
<p style="color: red" >Q12. Why does the request attribute report ‘null’ for the maintaining state demo?</p>
<p style="color: blue">A12. Because as soon as the server has finished generating the response for the request, the request doesn't exist anymore.  </p>
